" " , I looove this song , and the words ushering in a new eara of strong women that will NOT be crushed , ,	I love women coming up and going over the the rise of women should not be at the cost of or detriment peril of Men , Men and women should go hand in glove to conquer new heights and surge to yonder levels , Its for this purpose Allah God created men and women ,
" " , I looove this song , and the words ushering in a new eara of strong women that will NOT be crushed , ,	Sorry , but the Clip , the Chorigraphy and the words song meaning is mostly western side , it means western concept here , so the idea and the concept of the Strong womman or wommen is totaly wrong when you projected on our society and culture , wich is mostly islamic one , i think we should return to our originality , our arabic and even islamic way and thinking concept , wommen hasnt to live virtualy bythe idea tobe or to get stonger than what she is , and nor even has to compare her capacity with men , otherwise she wil lose many precious things in her lifeand wil never enjoy her time as womman
